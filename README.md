Project 2: Landing Page - Foundations Course

Create an entire web page from a design I was provided with. (Took it as inspo for some sections more than anything tbh)

Skills demonstrated/learned:
- Flexbox
- Adding a background image on CSS and gray scale/blur it only
- Creating a background image with text on top
- Discovered how to make background images fit content
- Zoom in when hover
- Text appear on hover (there has to be a better way to do this than what I did, right?)
- Change area of image shown
- Background video with text over
- Select multiple classes with div[class^=name-]
- The > selector
- Text Border
- Change cursor
- Make sticky bar not cover the header for sections
- Link to section in another page
- Move up animation
- A media query to change flexbox behavior

PS: Images sources and inspo are found on the Resources section: Sources
